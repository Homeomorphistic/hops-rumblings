    "Well, fun trivia, percentage comes from Latin _per centum_, which you guessed -- means _by hundred_ (don't quote me, it's on wiki). For us it just means a hundredth of a thing. The sign $(\\%)$ also looks like fraction right? The $20\\%$ means a $20$ pieces of a hundredth of a thing, in math terms $20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{20}{100}$. So $20\\%$ of 60 is:"
