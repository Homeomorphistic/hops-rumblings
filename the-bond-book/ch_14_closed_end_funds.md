# NAV and market price
Open-end funds are issued with an unlimited number of shares. When investor is buying shares
of one, new shares are issued and added capital allows the fund to buy additional securities.
The NAV of each share is calculated at the end of each trading day. It's total market value
divided by number of shares.

A Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares at its inception. Shares of CEF trade on the
exchange. At the end of trading day, the NAV is also calculated. This means the fund has to values:
market price and NAV, which can go in opposite direction, depending on demand.

# Discounts and premiums
There is no clear explanation what causes changes in price besides demand. The market price is only
equal to NAV at the issue. The process for orignating shares and bringing a fund to market involves
hidden fees. It means, that buying at issue some percentage of the NAV represents hidden commissions.
Many CEFs will begin to trade at discount to NAV later (after underwritters support). Buying a CEF
at issue is therefore quite expensive and not advisable.

# Leverage and yield
The main attraction of CEFs is higher yield than comparable open-end funds. This is happening when
you buy CEF at discount, because you are buying cheaper than contents are worth. Another way CEFs 
are boosting yield is through leverage. Leverage is most effective in boosting yield when the curve is
steeply upward sloping and the difference between short-term rates and long-term rates is high. It
is because leverage involves borrowing at short-term rates. If fund can borrow cheaply to finance
leverage and long-term rates are high, then investors are attracted and price of the fund rises.

Leverage magnifies profits and losses, so market price of CEF is often much more volatile than OEF.

There is no standardized way of calculating yield for CEFs, so they often use aggresive payout policies,
which liquidate fund and return some part of your principal (which is definitely not an income), but
it is considered in quotes.

Instead CEFs are required to calculate "income ratio", which is net investment income (minus expenses) 
divided by the fund's NAV. It is more accurate measure than the quoted "yield" of the actual income
generated.

# Exchange-traded funds
ETFs are priced on three different levels. A share of an ETF has a market price, which changes with the
demand. They have NAV, which may differ from market price. They also have Indicative Optimized 
Portfolio Value (IOPV). It is an intra-day estimate of fund NAV.

Institutional traders called Authorized Participants continuously buy and sell large baskets of securities
to create or redeem ETFs. These baskets are called "creation units". Only APs are authorized to trade them.

Authorized participants have unique opportunity to earn profits by arbitraging the price differences
between the scurities in the ETF and the share price of the ETF. If demand for the shares of an ETF 
is high, the share price of the ETF may go up and as a result, may be higher than the value of the underlying
portfolio of securities in the ETF. This gives APs the opportunity to purchase the underlying portfolio
of securities, create new ETF shares and sell the ETF shares in the secondary market at a profit.

There is a problem with this mechanic when it comes to bond ETFs -- they are traded on stock exchange, but
bonds are still bought over the counter. This means, that creation may require hours. There could be an imbalance
between buy and sell orders then the process may take even longer.

# Index drift and liquidity
In less liquid sectors ETFs need to use some methods to replicate the index, for example sampling techniques.
For example, the largest municipal bond ETF holds 839 bonds (2010), whereas its benchmark index is composed
of 7550 issues.

Theoretically, arbitrage trading of AP should keep the market price of ETFs close the the NAV and also close
to the index tracked. But this is not often the case, some could be purchased at discount. A somewhat simplified
explanation of this phenomenon is that AP's cost of trading bonds is incorporated into the market price of ETFs.
Escpecially in less liquid sectors, where bid/offer spread is high. As a result, in those sectors, under most
market conditions, ETFs can be expected to trade at premium to the NAV. Also, an index does not have expenses,
therefore expenses involved in "creating" shares will result in "performance drag" of an ETF.

# Advantages of ETFs
They are transparent -- NAV is calculated daily, securities are published in the net. There is also low cost.

In many respects, ETFs were designed for institutional investors. One strategy available through ETFs is shorting.
Another one is buying on margin. Both are risky strategies.

# Unit investment trusts
When buying UIT, you are purchasing a diversified portfolio of securities. The key characteristic of a UIT is that,
its portfolio remains unmanaged. Its price should rise toward par as the UIT approaches maturity. Typically it is
much smaller than other funds (around 10 issues). There is no annual expense, since no managment of it. It has
predictible income. The coupon is fixed only until the first bond matures or is called. Also, the shareholder
needs to reinvest income by himself and more importantly at unknown rate. Since no managment, there is no
protection, so you need to do research by yourself.
