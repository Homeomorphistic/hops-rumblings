# Markups and commisions
Bid is a price for which dealer will buy a bond. Ask is a price for which dealer will sell a bond. The difference between 
those prices is called _spread_ (this is a markup)

The size of the spread reflects bond's liquidity, which is the ease and cost of trading of a bond. Also size is influenced
by risk.

Unusually wide spread (4% or more) warns of bad quality.

# Dealers and brokers
A _dealer_ is someone who puts his own money at risk to buy and sell bonds. Dealers mark up the same bond independently,
so the price might differ.

A _broker_ is someone who executes a trade and in doing so earns a commission.

# Terms
The _par_ value of a bond is its value at maturity. Price less than par is called _discount_ and more than par is called _premium_.

The _accrued interest_ is interest that previous owner of a bond had earned. It is added to the price, when you buy,
so that you "turned over" his earnings.

_Call risk_ is the rist that bonds will be redeemed by the issuer before they mature. Usually happens when interest rates are lower,
so that the issuer can refinance its debt.
