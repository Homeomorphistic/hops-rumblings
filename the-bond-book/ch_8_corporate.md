# Uniquenness
There are five groups:

* Utilities, group consisting of both electric and telephone companies. They are
highly regulated (it depends on country) so are considered the safest of all 
corporate  bonds.
* Transportation, contains airlines and railroads.
* Industrials, largest and most diverse group, with industrial sector.
* Finance, group containing banks and insurance companies.
* Yankee bonds, issued by foreign issuers.

They are also classified by the security used as a collateral, for example it could be:
morgages, financial obligations or railway rolling stock. Corporates without collateral
are called debentures or notes.

Corporates yield is more attractive from any other, because credit rating is lower.
Also they are subject to more risk factors. At the time of writing the book, half 
of the corporates were junk status. There are various risks with calls.

# Event risk
Event risk is the uncertainty of takeover, which is almost impossible to predict.
There are many strategies called "bells and whistles", such as poison pills. Floating
rate notes and put bonds were intended to protect investors agains interest rate risk.

# Credit risk
Evaluating risk is more complex now, it requires measuring financial strength of a company,
just as with buying stocks. Factors to consider: economic trends, trends within industry,
ranking of the corporation within industry, quality of managment.

Ratings are assigned to each seprate issue, because they are ranked in order of priority
for payment in the event of default. Senior debt is paid first, so has higher rating.

During good economic times defaults are rare, but they are higher with recession.

There are different ratings for short-term corporate debt. A to D from S&P and P-1 to P-3
from Moody.

# Junk bonds
They are bonds below investment grade. The primary risk factor is not interest rate but
rather the risk that company may default. As a result, junk bonds tend to do poorly when
the economy is in a slump and better when economy strengthens. They have higher correlation
with the stock market than bond market. Junk bonds are typicall issued with 5-10 year 
maturity, so the interest risk is relatively modest.

# When to buy
For investment grade bonds, you want to buy corporates when the yields are higher than those
of treasuries by a significant amount, let's say 150 bp for maturities in 5-10 year range.
As always you have to decide whether the spread is wide enought to compenstate you for 
additional risk you are taking on. Some professionals feel that for individual inverstors
high-grade corporates do not have a spread that is wide enough to compensate for uncertainties.
