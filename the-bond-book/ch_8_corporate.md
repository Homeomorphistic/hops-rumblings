There are five groups:

* Utilities, group consisting of both electric and telephone companies. They are
highly regulated (it depends on country) so are considered the safest of all 
corporate  bonds.
* Transportation, contains airlines and railroads.
* Industrials, largest and most diverse group, with industrial sector.
* Finance, group containing banks and insurance companies.
* Yankee bonds, issued by foreign issuers.

They are also classified by the security used as a collateral, for example it could be:
morgages, financial obligations or railway rolling stock. Corporates without collateral
are called debentures or notes.

Corporates yield is more attractive from any other, because credit rating is lower.
Also they are subject to more risk factors. At the time of writing the book, half 
of the corporates were junk status. There are various risks with calls.
