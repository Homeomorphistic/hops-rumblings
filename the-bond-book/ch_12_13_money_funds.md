# Money market funds
They invest in short maturity debt instruments and their share price remains $1 per share.
The rank amongs the safests of funds. Over long time periods real returns from money market
funds are not likely to keep up with inflation.

# Fund names
Some fund names are misleading. For example, "government" bond fund may invest in trasuries,
federal agencies, GNMAs. "High income" also means many things, like corporates, junk, international.
Name gives no indication of maturity, credit quality, so before investing check fund contents.

# Buying junk funds
The main argument for buying junk bonds is diversification for a larga porfolio, because returns may
may not correlate with other sectors of the bond market such as treasuries or GNMAs. But if preservation
of capital is your goal and you have small portfolio, losses caused by junk funds may not be recoverable
for many years.

Another argument for speculation, but who cares about that?

# Principles of buying funds
* check out average maturity (and duration) so that you choose the right fund,
* low expense ratios,
* don't invest more than 20% of your bond portfolio iny any long-term, international or junk fund;
invest in those only with large portfolio
* funds are suited for complex securities like GNMAs, junk and corporates,

# Long-term returns
Longer-term funds should continue to have a higher total returns than shorter funds, because of compounding.
Dividends will be reinvester at higher rates than short-term funds. Over long holding periods, the income
portion of bond funds, that is interest income plus interest-on-interest should dominate total return.

# Checklist for analyzing
* estimate volatility (so maturity and duration), also check the actual returns of the fund for the last
few years,
* estimate credit quality, if more than 50% AAA then the fund is of high quality,
* look at expanse ratios
