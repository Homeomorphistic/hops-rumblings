# Interest rate risk
*All bonds are subject to interest rate rist*. The fundamental principle is that interest rates and prices move in inverse relationship.
Interest risk is correlated to maturity length. Bonds with short maturities are equivalent to cash.

Changes in prices are not linear, they are ocurring at declining rate, which becomes noticeable after 10-year mark.
The change is also different if the interest rate goes up or down.

_Convexity_ is a property of bond -- it appreciates more in value if interest rates decline than it loses if interest rates rise.

Bonds purchased above par or below par will converge to par value with time.

Swapping old bonds with lower coupon to newer with higher (but similar maturity and credit quality) will be indifferent.
This is because the buyer (at his price) of your old bond would be indifferent to buying your bond or newer.
Swapping also generates commissions.

# Credit risk
Credit rating are intended to indicate the probability of default, that is repaying debt on time in full and paying interest on time in full.

Some fiduciary institutions (like bank) are permitted by law to invest only in securities rated at minimum _investment grade_.
_Investment grade_ are securities above BBB (S&P), Baa (Moody).

Credit ratings affect the cost of borrowing. Bonds with higher quality will carry the lowest yields, bonds with lower quality yield more.
The yield provides scale of creditworthiness: higher yields indicate higher risk.

_Credit quality spread_ is differences in yield between bonds of the same maturity, but with different ratings.
Credit quality spread wides as riskiness is perceived to increas, either as maturities become longer or credit quality lower.
*Many proffesional traders base trading strategies on the extent to which the spreads vary from what is considered "normal".*

# Credit rating
Rating scales for each sector of the bond market. The bonds are compared within the sector, not globally (but changes are coming).

# Rates of return
Real rate of return of a bond is nominal rate subtracted (?) infation rate.
