# International bond market
Domestic bonds are issued within a foreign country in that country's currency. Foreign
bonds are issued by a borrower located outside a country but which are intended primarly
for local investors. Yankee bonds are dollar-denominated, but issued by insitutions outside
of US.

# Credit ratings
Credit ratings are conducted by all three major credit rating agencies. They rate separetely
debt denominated in the local currency and in a foreign currency. This is because defaults
are much more common on debt denominated in foreign currency.

# Currency risk
Foreign-pay bonds are subject to the same risks as other bonds, that is interest rate risk
and credit risk. They are also subject to currency risk (exchange-rate risk). Over short periods
(a year or less) fluctuations in the value of currency are often the most significant component
of total return, dwarfing both interest income and changes in price.

# Case for international bonds
The first argument is diversifiaction. This is based on the fact that total returns of those bonds
do not correlate with total return of US bonds. Applying it to the portfolio is appropriate for
very large and extremely diversified portfolios of institutions. For individual investors this
argument is irrelevant and does not support the objective of safe, predictable income.

The other argument could be hedging your local currency, but predicting currency movements is 
not for amateurs.
