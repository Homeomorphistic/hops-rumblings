# Individual bonds vs funds
Main difference is that bonds have maturity date, while funds not. Bonds are redeemed at par
on maturity date, so if no default happens you get back principal. Also, they earn predictable
income. Most bond funds will maintain constant maturity, so short or long term funds will
have only those bonds. Net asset value of a fund will be always changing depending on variety
of factors.

# Bond fund yield
Bond funds do not have a maturity, so they is no way to compute YTM. Instead they calculate
stadardized SEC yield. It's a snapshot of actual returns of a fund for the past 30 days.
It takes into account accrued interest, but also increases (or decreases) in bonds prices.
The expenses are also subtracted.

There is also distribution yield, which is based solely on dividends distributed last month.
It is comparable to current yield of a bond.

# Total return
Tables/graph do not cover commisions and taxes!

# Interest rate risk
Just like with bonds, bond funds price declines and rises with interest rate. The longer maturities
of bonds in the fund the more volatile it is. The risk for funds therefore reimains constant,
because fund is selling and buying up bonds so that it stays within its maturity range.

# Sell-off risk
It happens when too many people withdraw their money and fund loses value when selling their sometimes
best liquid assets.

# Bankrupcy risk
There is almost no risk of fund going bust, because funds are separated and it is not the company money.
Also the mutual funds cannot pledge, mortgage or hypothecate fund assets.

# Advantages of funds
They are cheap and effective diversification. Also, they are liquid and convenient (automatic reinvestment).
More importantly they cover more complex securities. They can buy securities cheaply.

Over the long time interest-on-interest is more important, so frequent reinvestment in case of funds
offers higher return.

# Disadventages of funds
Main one is that you cannot be sure that you will recover principal in full. The fund is also reducing retun
by its expenses.

# Volatility
Never buy a long-term fund for short holding puposes, because changes in NAV will affect total return more
than interest income. However, over the long holding periods (10 years or more) income produced by reinvesting
interest income, if compounded, becomes the main component of the return.
