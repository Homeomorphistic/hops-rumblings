# Maturity matching (bullet portfolio)
You buy securities which will mature at the time principal is needed. Typical uses of this
kind of portfolio are things you want to save for in near future, like vacations, car, home.

Buying bonds that will mature later enables you to go out further along the yield curve.
This structure also eliminates risk with losing principal prior to the time that money is needed.
If rates seem attractive, then the zeros aer an attractive option since they also eliminate
reinvestment risk.

For investors with large portfolios another portfolio structure is "weighted maturity".
You choose combination of bonds whose duration is close to the expected target date.
This protects erosion of principal. Weighting the maturities enables you to take advantage
of attractive buy points in the yield curve.

For most investors intermediate maturities are enough, especially for those looking for a source
of steady income or lower the volatility of investment portfolio. Depending on objectives there
are a variety of strategies.

# Ladders
It's a very conservative approach. You start with dividing money among bonds with different maturities.
For example, one-year, three-year, five-year bonds. You would place approximately equal amounts of money
into each bond. As bond matures, you replace it with a bond equal to the longest maturity (in this case 5 year).

If you are investing primarly for income, then you would choose a ladder with longer maturity structure.
This structure has a number of advantages. Replacing maturing bonds regardless of interest rates is similar
to dollar cost-averaging. This structure also provides some protection -- keeping the average-weighted maturity
of your portfolio short to intermediate protects against interest rate risk. So does holding until maturity.

# The barbell
Approximately half of the portfolio is short-term (under 2 years) and the other half is in long-term (20-30 years).
The combination of long and short maturities produces portfolio that has an intermediate average-weighted maturity.
Income from this type is generally lower than just buying intermediate.

Institutional investors use this structure if they think interest rates are about to decline at the long end. If
they are wrong they hedged their bets using shorter maturities as cushion.

This strategy can backfire, when short-term rates drop and long-term rates rise. This happens whenever the yield
curve becomse steeply upward.

# Finding attractive buy points
A sector of a bond market can be an attractive buy when the yield spread is wide "enough". They give you an idea
of how attractive or how risky any sector may be at given time. If spread is narrow, than the yield is not enough
to compenstate for riskiness.

# Managing a bond portfolio for total return
This implies a strategy that minimizes transaction costs, maximizes reinvestment rates, and preserves capital.
Buy and hold, rather than trade. Some securities like MBS, junk and international bonds are most efficiently 
bought through funds.

**If you are buying individual bonds, the longer you exted maturities, the higher the credit quality you should require.** 

For the long run investing in a tax-deferred account reinvestment rates are particulary important. This is because over
long holding periods, compounding, through interest-on-interest, constitutes the largest part of total return. Boosting
reinvestment rates results in higher compounded interest income.

# Asset allocation
Basic idea 60/40, 60% of index ETFs, 40% of treasuries. For more risk-averse investors, swap to 40/60.
More affluent investors could use munis instead of treasuries, for higher yield with modest increase
in risk.

Bonds are not correlated with stocks (no argument there?).
