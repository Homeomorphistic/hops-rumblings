# Yield spreads
US treasuries, especialy 10-year ones are the most widely traded in the world. Following the US bond market therefore is highly recommended
to understand current market mood. 

They are deemed to be risk free, so every other bond will yield more. The difference between US treasury and other securities yield is
called _yield spread_.

# Yield curve
Graph of maturities vs YTM. The "normal" shape of this curve is when yields of longer maturities are higher. Otherwise it is inverted.

The shape changes with expectations of major inverstors (institutions). If buyers expect inflation and rise in interest rates they
seek the safety of short-term bonds and as a result short rates decline. If they expect lower rates, recession then they
"lock in" high yields of longer bonds and decline long-term rates.

Steep yield curve is considered "bullish" for the economy and thought to forecasat rising long-term rates. The inverted curve is thought
to predict recession (historicaly not always).

Yield curve can be used by individual investor to find buy points within maturities. One can ask oneself how much more can he earn
by taking more risk (longer maturity). 

# Shopping guidelines
Start with deciding on maturity, credit quality and yield (in this order). You should start with determining the risk you are willing to take.
