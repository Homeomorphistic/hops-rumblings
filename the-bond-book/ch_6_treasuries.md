It is advised to start buying bonds with about 50k (if individual bonds cost 1k) so that one can properly diversify.

# Uniqueness of treasuries
They are common and high quiality (an oxymoron in finance?). Backed by the ultimate insurer they are safe.
Always compare other securities to treasuries with similar maturities. Never buy one without large enough
yield to compensate for the additional credit risk. The greater the risk the wider spread should be.

Treasuries are for risk averse / have not enough time for analysis buy treasuries.

The price of long treasuries is volatile as the price of any other long-dated securities.
Limit yourself to purchasing maturities 5 year or less and hold to maturity to protect your principal. 

Treasuries often outperform other debt instruments. This is because investors flee from other securities
when markets are down (it's called "flight to quality buying").

# Treasury bills, notes and bonds
T-bills are short-dated instruments, 1 year or less (currently 3,6,12-months). They do not have any
coupons, are bought at discount and redeemed at higher par. Basically they are risk free, interes rate risk
may be ignored. Institutions use them as cash equivalent.

Treasury notes mature in 2-10 years (currently 2,3,5,7,10 year). Interest rate risk increases significantly
after 5-year mark.

Treasury bonds mature in 10-30 years (currently 10,30 year). They are not callable for 25 years,
which is better than other securities.

# TIPS
Treasury inflation protected securities share most characteristics of other treasuries (like credit quality).
Currently their are issued at 5,10,30 year maturities. Their face value is adjusted periodically based on
Consumer Price Index, which means that with constant coupon rate, income will rise.

You are guaranteed a real rate of return. Historically, the real rate of return of treasuries has
*averaged about 3% above inflation.*

There is a protection for deflation, bond will be redeemed at par if after deflation it would be lower,
but deflation lowers the par value!

It seems that interest rates have more influence on the price of TIPS rather than inflation rate.
Contrary to the beliefs TIPS are more volatile than bonds at the same maturity. For one, it has
lower coupon than other bonds, so a higher duration. Also expectations of inflation play a role.

They are bad short-term investments because of their high volatility.

There is some problem with taxing the increases of face value, called "phantom income", but 
I didn't understand it clearly. It is advised to use tax advantaged accounts.

# TIPS vs coupons
It's hard to compare them, because you don't know the inflation rate, for which face value of TIPS will
be increased. It is impossible to decide whos yield will be higher, it's only possible to say that TIPS
will parallel the inflation rate.
