It is advised to start buying bonds with about 50k (if individual bonds cost 1k) so that one can properly diversify.

# Uniqueness of treasuries
They are common and high quiality (an oxymoron in finance?). Backed by the ultimate insurer they are safe.
Always compare other securities to treasuries with similar maturities. Never buy one without large enough
yield to compensate for the additional credit risk. The greater the risk the wider spread should be.

Treasuries are for risk averse people or those with not enough time for analysis.

The price of long treasuries is volatile as the price of any other long-dated securities.
Limit yourself to purchasing maturities 5 year or less and hold to maturity to protect your principal. 

Treasuries often outperform other debt instruments. This is because investors flee from other securities
when markets are down (it's called "flight to quality buying").

# Treasury bills, notes and bonds
T-bills are short-dated instruments, 1 year or less (currently 3,6,12-months). They do not have any
coupons, are bought at discount and redeemed at higher par. Basically they are risk free, interest rate risk
may be ignored. Institutions use them as cash equivalent.

Treasury notes mature in 2-10 years (currently 2,3,5,7,10 year). Interest rate risk increases significantly
after 5-year mark.

Treasury bonds mature in 10-30 years (currently 10,30 year). They are not callable for 25 years,
which is better than other securities.

# TIPS
Treasury inflation protected securities share most characteristics of other treasuries (like credit quality).
Currently their are issued at 5,10,30 year maturities. Their face value is adjusted periodically based on
Consumer Price Index, which means that with constant coupon rate, income will rise.

You are guaranteed a real rate of return. Historically, the real rate of return of (coupon) treasuries has
*averaged about 3% above inflation.*

There is a protection for deflation, bond will be redeemed at par if after deflation it would be lower,
but deflation lowers the par value!

It seems that interest rates have more influence on the price of TIPS rather than inflation rate.
Contrary to the beliefs TIPS are more volatile than bonds at the same maturity. For one, it has
lower coupon than other bonds, so a higher duration. Also expectations of inflation play a role.

They are bad short-term investments because of their high volatility.

There is some problem with taxing the increases of face value, called "phantom income", but 
I didn't understand it clearly. It is advised to use tax advantaged accounts.

# TIPS vs coupons
It's hard to compare them, because you don't know the inflation rate, for which face value of TIPS will
be increased. It is impossible to decide whose yield will be higher, it's only possible to say that TIPS
will parallel the inflation rate.

# TreasuryDirect
It's a platform for purchasing treasuries directly from the Fed. It costs 25$ anually if you hold over
100k$. It's directed for those who hold bonds to maturity, but there is an option of selling bonds, with
a fee of 45$. It seems that the Fed is looking for a dealer to sell your bond (and you pay for that service).
But there are no fees for buying!

There is a problem with purchasing -- you still buy a security at some average market price. It is an 
"noncompetitive tender", where you agree to purchase the maturity at the average yield of the auction (average
of all the competitive tenders submitted by dealers).

The platform sells only new issues, any other must be bought with a broker.

# Zero coupon bonds
Colloquially known as "strips", because of the process of creating them. Behind every zeros are plain treasuries.
Banks in the 80's got the idea to separate cashflows from bond (coupons and principal). There are no interest coupons.
Instead the zeros are sold at deep discount. Interestingly, they also contain interest-on-interest. For example,
investing 197$ at 8.3% coupon rate will yield 1000$ in 20 years.

They have no reinvestment risk! Reinvesting is build in and it's very efficient. When buying zeros, you
lock in YTM, reinvesting is done at this rate, which is known from the begining.

Markups are very high, so sometimes if the maturity of zero is low, it's better to buy a coupon treasury.
They are attractive to buy only if YTM is attractive.

Interest rate (accrued) is actually taxed annualy, so again, they are great for tax advantaged accounts.

Also they have the highest duration, because of no coupons, so they are the most volatile.

# Savings bonds
Again no risk of issuer. Interest income is exempt from state and federal taxes.

Series EE -- these bonds earn 90% of the average rate of five-year treasury notes sold at auction for
the previous six months. Interest rates are reset every six months. They are accrual bonds (zero coupon).
They are sold at 50% discount. You cannot predict when they reach face value, because that will depend
on the interest rates while you hold the bonds. They have some maturity, but most of them goes automaticly
to extended period. They can earn interest for up to 30 years. They can be redeemed earlier, but with some penalty.

Series I -- they resemble TIPS and payments are adjusted for inflation. Also accrual.

Both of these bonds are not traded in the secondary market, so they cannot lose value.
