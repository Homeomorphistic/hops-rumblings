## GNMA
GNMA (Government national mortgage assosiation) is first mortgage-backed security (1970),
mainly an institutional product. It has backing of the US government, so high credit quality,
high cash flow (monthly) and higher yield than treasuries.

That agency does not issue bonds, its role is that of an insurer and facilitator.

They have no credit risk, but they expose to interest rate (and price) risk. Also, you
don't know the cash flow amount, timings of cash flows and how long will it be outstanding.
Each GNMA is unique, so that two GNMAs with similar coupons and maturities perform differently.

Analysis of this security focuses on longevity -- how long coupon payments are likely to continue
-- and by that its total return.

# GNMA cash flows
The process of creating GNMA security starts with builder, that obtained financing and sold
a number of houses. This mortgage originator applies to the GNMA for a pool number and its backing.
Only insured mortgages are accepted, so GNMA is able to guarantee timely payments and return 
of principal. The mortgages are bundled together into one pool of min. $1 million. Pieces of
those pools are then sold to investors.

Mortgages bundled together are similar. All mortgages are fixed rate, they are issued for 20 
to 30 years and at the same interest rate. The servicer receives payments and sends them to 
investors charging for his services. Payments are defined by "amortization schedule".

# Prepayments and cash flows of GNMA
Homeowners can sell their homes and prepay their mortgages for many personal reasons or economical
(like refinancing to lower interest rate). Reducing interest rate of mortgage ties prepayments
directly to interst rates.

Prepayments complicate the cash flows of a GNMA. Much of the time, prepayments on GNMA cease before
original terms of mortgages. There is no interest on prepaid principal. Prepayments speed up the return
of principal and shorten the amount of GNMA time and as a result GNMAs are viewed as intermediate
rather than long-term securities.

Due to unpredictability of prepayments no pool behaves the same way.

**All this uncertainties are reason that GNMAs yield more than treasuries.**

# Interest rate and GNMAs
GNMAs react to interest rate as any other fixed income security, but in their own way. Suppose interest
rate declines significantly, so the homeowners are likely to rush to refinance. GNMAs are then more likely
to get more prepayments and you get lots of principal back when rates are lower. Now you have to
reinvest at lower rates. This is way GNMAs may decline in value and your return will be lower.

Suppose interest rates rise. Prepayments are slowing down, so longer life of GNMA. So you are holding
GNMA longer when rates are higher and the price is likeyl to decline more than intermediate bonds.

Conclusions: volatility is slighltly less because GNMAs are treated as intermediate instruments.
**They yield more than treasuries on current yield basis, but when total return is considered, 
there are time periods when they may not perform as well as treasuries.**

# Prepayment assumptions
At first prepayment patters is based on the data compiled by the Federal Housing Administration
and was used to compare pools of GNMAs. Then came CPR model (constant prepayment rate) with
constant rates of mortgages prepays. At the time of writing book the standard is Public Securities
Association (PSA) model. It's a combination of previous models.

Average life is a technical term that approximates time , when half of the principal will be paid.
It is used to compare the cash flow from GNMA to the YTM of a treasury whos maturity is the same
as average life.

# Par, discount and premium GNMAs
GNMAs are traded at par only when issued. They have no prepayment history and would be priced
on average expectation. They are likely to be outstaning longer since no prepayments.

Discount GNMAs have lower coupons. If interest rate remain stable, prepayments are less likely
to speed up, since coupon rates are lower than current. They are more sensitive to interest
rate than par or premium and so more volatile.

Premiium GNMAs have higher coupons. If interest rates rise, the high coupon acts as brake
and cushions agains declines in price. Tis is why premiums are hedge against rising interest.
In case of steep decline of interest rates prepayments speed up and you have to invest at
lower interest rate.

# Asset-backed securities (ABS)
Almost any type of loan can be repackaged into an asset-backed bond. The largest segment
of that market was based on credit card loans.

# Colaterized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)
Initially it was conceived to remove uncertainties of prepayments. The cash flows from mortgage-
-backed securities have been restructured into series of bonds with more predictable average lives
and prepayments. The key difference is that CMO payment streams are redistributed to a number of 
different "tranches". A CMO may have 3-50 tranches.

The simplest CMOs are called __sequential pay__ or __plan vanilla__ CMOs. Let's assume that we
are putting together a CMO comprised of several GNMA pools. This CMO will have 3 tranches, all 
of them are receiving payments. Unscheduled prepayments are sent __sequentially__ to each tranche.
The first tranche receives all unscheduled prepayments, say, during first three years. Then it is 
retired. This way it could be sold as a bond with an approximate three-year maturity. Unscheduled
payments made during next three years go to the second tranche, which is retired, say, in eight years.
The third tranche receives the rest of prepayments. The time of CMO remains more predictable,
investors seeking short-term maturities would buy earlier tranches and long-term later tranches.
The buyers of later tranches would receive initially only interest payments.

The interest payments vary with riskiness of the tranches. The shortes and least risky receive lower
interest.

# Planed amortization tranches and companions
The exact reverse of prepayment risk is called __extension risk__. It is when interest rates rise sharply
and prepayments slow down. This event causes CMOs to become unpredictable again. To further limit that 
risk new types of tranches were invented -- __planned amortization class__ (PAC) and __companions__.
The idea is to move unwanted prepayments from PAC tranches to companion tranche. The companion tranche
is more risky and volatile, but with a higher yield.

Most CMOs have a principal lockout period, during which only interest payments are received. The period
during which payments of principal are received is know as the "payment window".

# Agencies
First CMOs were backed by government agencies: GNMA (Ginnie Mae), Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA, Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac). In some time Fannie
and Freddie became private corporations. They issue they own debt instruments to buy mortgages, which
they later repackage into MBS.

GNMA remains a government agency, so it has guaranteed government help. Both Fannie and Freddie are
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which are publibcly traded at stock exchanges. They have the
ability to borrow directly from government. Until the crisis it meant implicit AAA rating on the debt
of those agencies.

# Private-label mortgages
First thing to change was CMOs that did not have agency backing, knows as "private-label". Initially
they were based on "jumbo mortgages", very large martgages typically taken out by affluent homebuyers.

Next were CMOs with sub-prime mortgages. It's estimated that by 2006, approximately 50% of MBS were based
on subprime mortgages.

# Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
CDOs are more complex versions of CMOs, with larger pools of debt obligations subdivided into tranches
consisting of senior tranches and less senior tranches. Each tranche was itself incredibly complex.

# Collateralized debt swaps (CDSs)
These are so-called "synthetic CDOs". These were basically bets that some CDOs were going to go bust.
