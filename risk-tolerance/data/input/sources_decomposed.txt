Note 7 from "Irrational Exuberance" about interest rates data

Starting in 1953, the interest rate is the yield of a monthly ten-year Treasury Bond
series from the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Before 1953, the
data are interpolated to monthly from annual average data in Sidney Homer, A History
of Interest Rates (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1963); for 1871–1900,
from Table 38, col. 3, p. 288; for 1901–20, from Table 45, col. 14, p. 341; for 1921–46, from
Table 48, col. 1, p. 352; and for 1947–53, from Table 50, col. 1, p. 359. Jeremy Siegel has
a very similar government bond yield series (www.jeremysiegel.com) that he has
studied in detail in his article “The Real Rate of Interest from 1800–1990: A Study of
the U.S. and the U.K.,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 29 (1992): 227–52.

Note 3 from "Irrational Exuberance" about stock prices

The price, dividend, and earnings series are from the same sources as described
in Chapter 26 of my earlier book Market Volatility (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press,
1989), although now I use monthly data, rather than annual data. Monthly dividend
and earnings data are computed from the S&P four‑quarter totals for the quarter
since 1926, with linear interpolation to monthly figures. Dividend and earnings data
before 1926 are from Cowles and associates (Common Stock Indexes, 2nd ed. [Bloom-
ington, Ind.: Principia Press, 1939]), interpolated from annual data. Stock price data
are monthly averages of daily closing prices.
