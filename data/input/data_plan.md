- see if you can recreate some returns, like germany/france.
- use oecd data to compute other countries TR
- compare them to TBSP
- complete G7 countries (italy missing) and maybe add more to reach G20 (probably china)
- find out what's present bond market constituents and make your own bond index
- compare it to FTSE DM GOV
